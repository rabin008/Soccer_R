# Predicting soccer outcomes with R

This repo aims to provide practical examples of how some statistical models can be applied to predicting soccer outcomes. That being stated, this repo does not contain formal proof or evidence of why the models can be implemented or if they could be accurate at predicting said soccer outcomes.

## Data sources

The datasets were obtained from the following links:

PL-2022-23: https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

## Exploratory analysis

Before even thinking about adjusting any model, let's try to create some simple graphs to get familiar with the datasets. All code relevant to these graphs can be found in the `explanatory_analysis.R` file.
